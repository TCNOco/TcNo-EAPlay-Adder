### What is this?

EA Play is great. You get games for a cheap subscription price.  
Only issue: You need to click "Play Now" under EVERY EA PLAY GAME on the Steam Store for them to appear in your library.  
This project simplifies that into a few clicks. Each ticked game below attempts to "open", and is added to your Steam Library.

### Why open-source?

While anyone can view a website's code, this project now has a GitHub repo, for those who would like to add games to the list. There aren't notifications for Steam getting new EAPlay games... But I do see GitHub notifications. Create a PR with new games added to it, and I'll merge then sync with my website.
